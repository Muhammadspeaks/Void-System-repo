1) What's sxhkd

- sxhkd (Simple X hotkey daemon) is a simple X hotkey daemon, by the developer of bspwm, that reacts to input events by executing commands. 
Configuration file that sxkhd program intiates with is found is $HOME/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc

2) Function

- What sxhkd simply do is listen ti the keys/keybindings you click on your keyboard and excutes the command if it found a match in the sxhkdrc file

For example:

in sxhkdrc you probably find something like this: 
                
                    super + w
                            firefox

while typing, if you pressed super key (Win key) + w, it'll open firefox.
This simply happens because sxhkd simulates as you was in a shell and typed the command by yourself like 

                    [user@host ~]$ firefox 

3) Notes

- sxhkd only restarts or does not apply any changes you made in the shxkdrc file unless you rebooted or restarted the xorg service (X-server).
But in the manual page there's a way that you can make sxhkd apply the new changes by sending SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 signal to sxhkd process number.

I already have an alias for that in my .bashrc file which is 
                                
                    kill -10 $(pidof sxhkd)

where -10 is SIGUSR1 signal number and the command "pidof sxhkd" gets the sxhkd process number
